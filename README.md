# 100 Days of Code -- Python (Angela Yu)

This repository documents my personal progress in the course **"100 Days
of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"**, instructed by **Angela
Yu**.

It contains the source code of projects developed from **Day 1 to Day
14**, with the exception of **Day 6** and **Day 13**, which do not
include projects in the original course curriculum.

## Overview

The primary objective of this repository is to consolidate my learning
throughout the course by implementing the proposed projects while
intentionally introducing modifications to the original solutions.

Rather than strictly reproducing the instructor's code, I aim to: 
- Reinforce Python fundamentals through practice 
- Explore alternative approaches and logic 
- Apply small improvements, refactoring, or extensions to the projects 
- Maintain a clear record of my learning progression over time

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course day, following a clear and
scalable structure:

``` text
day01-band-name/
day02-tip-calculator/
day03-treasure-island/
...
day14-higher-or-lower/
day15-coffee-machine/
day16-oop-coffee-machine/
```

Each directory may contain: 
- Python source files (`.py`) 
- Adjustments or variations from the original project specifications 
- Minor enhancements or additional features when applicable

This structure is designed to scale easily as more days are added.

## Progress Status

- Completed days: **1--15**
- Skipped days (no original projects): **6, 13**
- Current status: **In progress**
- Target completion: **Day 100 (or as close as possible)**

This section will be updated continuously throughout the course.

## Technologies

-   Python 3
-   Standard Python libraries
-   Terminal-based applications (for early-stage projects)

## Future Development

This README and repository are intentionally structured to allow
straightforward updates as the course advances.

Planned future additions include: 
- New directories for subsequent course days 
- Code refinements and refactoring of earlier projects 
- Optional documentation of challenges and learning outcomes

## Course Reference

This repository is based on the course:

**100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**\
Instructor: **Angela Yu**

All original project concepts and learning materials are credited to the
course author.

This repository serves as a long-term learning log and practical
reference throughout the duration of the course.
